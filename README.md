# DKC1Recomp-NX 1.0.3

[![Support me on Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/mr0ta)

If you enjoy this port, you can support it on
[Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/mr0ta).

This fork adds, on top of DKC1Recomp and its Switch port:

- **Nintendo Switch at 60 fps**: own audren audio output, fixed 60 Hz frame
  cadence, CPU at 1785 MHz, emulation and HD work on separate cores, and an
  in-game menu (R3, or Plus + Minus) with save states, rewind, MSU-1 and HD
  switches, cheats (infinite lives, Pro Action Replay codes) and a
  frame-time HUD. See [docs/SWITCH.md](docs/SWITCH.md).
- **HD texture mod** generated from your own ROM (pack format v2: two
  palette colors and a blend weight per HD pixel, composed on the GPU,
  with the 8x8 tile seams smoothed where the original art has none). See
  [docs/HD_MOD_README.md](docs/HD_MOD_README.md) and
  [docs/HD_REMASTER.md](docs/HD_REMASTER.md).
- **Compressed MSU-1 music** (Ogg Vorbis, decoded on its own thread, with
  windowed-sinc resampling).
- **Widescreen HUD**: banana and lives counters anchored to the screen edges.
- **1.0.3**: steady 60 fps on Switch with HD and MSU-1 (scanlines drawn on
  three cores, cheaper GPU passes and uploads, faster SPC uploads),
  enemies and objects no longer vanish at the right edge of the picture,
  the lives balloon stays next to its number, and the in-game menu is in
  English or Spanish.

No ROM, graphics or music are included or distributed.

# DKC1Recomp

Static recompilation of *Donkey Kong Country* (SNES, USA v1.0) into a native
desktop application, using the project's pinned
[`snesrecomp` fork](https://github.com/elliotttate/snesrecomp)
framework — following the working [`DKC2Recomp`](https://github.com/Nicktendonick/DKC2Recomp)
project (same Rare engine family) as the template.

**Status: playable bring-up.** The project has 100% statically generated game
code, a headless validation host, playable Windows and native macOS hosts,
continuous audio, and an opt-in 342x224 widescreen presentation path. See `docs/BRINGUP.md` for the
chronological bring-up record and `docs/WIDESCREEN.md` for the widescreen
architecture, ported SuperZSNES findings, validation, and limitations.

Windows releases now include the Mac host's graphics, CRT/reconstruction,
16:10/16:9, remapping, Assist, music and mod controls in a dark native menu and
settings panel. See [Windows build, features and validation](docs/WINDOWS_RELEASE.md).

## Why this game is a strong recomp candidate


Unlike most bring-ups, DKC1 does not need blind code discovery: the
[Yoshifanatic1 DKC1 disassembly](https://github.com/Yoshifanatic1/Donkey-Kong-Country-1-Disassembly)
(GPL-3) rebuilds the ROM byte-identically, and an IDA-based pipeline over it
(in the disassembly repo under `Tools/IDA/`) provides:

- the exact start and size of **every instruction** (53,230 instructions /
  126,790 bytes) derived from the asar symbol map — no heuristics;
- 1,276 function entries with proven entry M/X flag states;
- **complete target lists for the indirect-dispatch sites**, extracted from
  the disassembly's own `dw` jump tables (25 sites, 293 targets — including
  the 460-entry game-mode dispatcher and the animation-command table);
- ~90 semantically identified engine routines and RAM addresses.

`tools/ingest_dkc1_disasm.py` distills that into the per-bank CFG files in
`recomp/`. DKC1 executes all code from banks **80-BF** (low-RAM-mirror halves
of HiROM); the cfg banks follow that layout.

## Supported ROM

Headerless *Donkey Kong Country* USA v1.0:

| Property | Expected value |
| --- | --- |
| Size | 4,194,304 bytes |
| SHA-256 | `fa8cacf5bbfc39ee6bbaa557adf89133d60d42f6cf9e1db30d5a36a469f74d15` |

The ROM must remain outside Git. No ROM bytes, extracted assets, or generated
game code are committed.

For controlled testing of a data-only ROM produced by a level editor, the
runtime can opt into one exact modified 4 MB payload. Set
`DKC1_ALLOW_ROM_SHA256` to that file's complete SHA-256 digest and pass the same
file on the command line. This does not disable verification: a missing,
malformed, or non-matching value is rejected, and the clean retail digest
remains the only accepted default. Because the native game code was generated
from the supported retail ROM, use this development override only for a patch
whose changed ranges have been audited as data.

The macOS host also accepts `DKC1_STARTUP_SCRIPT=/path/to/route.dks` for editor
playtests. It runs an input/wait-only deterministic route from clean power-on
before showing the first interactive frame; save-state and checkpoint commands
are rejected. RainbowZ combines this with an exact modified-ROM hash pin to
open its generated Jungle Hijinxs level directly without a reusable save state.

## Debugging and validation

The widescreen port is developed from byte-exact, deterministic evidence—not
screenshots alone. [`docs/WIDESCREEN_DEBUG_TOOLS.md`](docs/WIDESCREEN_DEBUG_TOOLS.md)
defines the native debug-tool roadmap, ordered from per-frame decision traces
and replayable snapshots through object-lifecycle analysis and whole-game
level sweeps. [`docs/WIDESCREEN_HANDOFF.md`](docs/WIDESCREEN_HANDOFF.md)
records the current evidence, hashes, open issues, and release gates.
[`docs/HOST_PACING.md`](docs/HOST_PACING.md) documents the Windows compositor
clock, audio/save-state recovery, JSONL profiler, measured baselines, and the
deterministic stall-recovery test.

## Licensing and third-party code

Project-authored host and tooling code is MIT licensed. The pinned
`snesrecomp` framework has its own PolyForm Noncommercial license and
third-party notices. DKC structural metadata retains its documented GPL-3
disassembly provenance. See [`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).

## Generate the recompiled sources

```powershell
git submodule update --init --recursive
python scripts\generate_snesrecomp.py --rom "C:\private\dkc1.sfc"
```

Output lands in ignored `generated/snesrecomp/`. Regenerate `recomp/*.cfg`
from the disassembly pipeline with:

```powershell
python tools\ingest_dkc1_disasm.py --work "<disassembly>\Tools\IDA\work" --out recomp
```

Generation automatically runs the fail-closed widescreen override pass. It
adapts only source-visible culling, object activation, and direct-OAM packing;
logical camera, collision, exits, boss arenas, and tile streaming remain the
cartridge program.

## Build and run

With a Visual Studio developer environment available:

```powershell
.\build_host.bat
.\build\dkc1_desktop.exe "C:\private\dkc1.sfc"
```

The desktop host enables widescreen by default. Set `DKC1_WIDESCREEN=0` for
the exact 256x224 presentation path. At a level's authored walls the
4:3 edge stays pinned at the wall and the inward view is released gradually
over eight margins of travel, so nothing past the level is shown; View >
Level Edge on macOS (or `DKC1_WIDESCREEN_EDGE=reflect|bars|shift|glide`)
switches to a view locked to the camera with the terrain mirrored past the
wall, black past the wall, or the earlier inward clamp. The headless validator accepts a frame
count and supports deterministic input playback and private frame/state
captures; its environment variables are documented in `docs/BRINGUP.md`.

### macOS

Install CMake, Ninja, and SDL2, then provide the same verified ROM the first
time private generated sources are needed:

```sh
brew install cmake ninja sdl2
./build_macos.sh "/path/to/Donkey Kong Country (USA).sfc"
open build/macos/DKC1Recomp.app
```

The arm64 app targets macOS 26 or newer, includes its SDL2 runtime, and opens a
native ROM picker when launched without arguments; the ROM is never copied into
the app. Keyboard
controls match Windows (arrows, Z/X/S/A, Q/W, Return, Right Shift), and SDL
game controllers are supported. F7 pauses, F8 steps, F9 exports an armed
flight-recorder bundle, F11/F12 quick-save/load, and Option-Return toggles
fullscreen. Native Game and View menus expose those commands plus checked
4:3, 16:10 (308x224), and 16:9 (342x224) aspect-ratio options, layer
isolation, and provenance controls. `DKC1_ASPECT=16:10` selects the
Mac-oriented mode at startup. The Mac host presents SNES pixels at their 7:6
pixel aspect. Fullscreen uses the maximum undistorted fractional fit and offers
three persistent host-only samplers: the default `Sharp Bilinear` keeps flat
source-pixel interiors with an approximately one-output-pixel transition,
`Smooth (Linear)` applies conventional bilinear filtering, and `Pixel Sharp
(Nearest)` retains hard edges with uneven output-column widths at fractional
scales. All three fill the same area, and the source framebuffer and native
256-pixel center remain unchanged. Saves and
diagnostics live under macOS Application Support. For controlled launch or QA,
`DKC1_START_FULLSCREEN=1` enters the same fullscreen path after the renderer is
created. The release host keeps cartridge emulation on one absolute 60 Hz
Mach-clock schedule. A native `CAMetalDisplayLink` presenter independently
requests 120 Hz and normally scans each immutable game frame twice from a
three-frame host queue. SDL renderer vsync is disabled so it cannot form a
second blocking cadence gate. Set
`DKC1_FPS_STATS=1` to print renderer, display-callback, workload-phase,
submission, and present-wait telemetry when the app exits.
`DKC1_SCANOUT_LOG=path` records actual drawable `presentedTime` together with
source-frame, camera, and PPU-scroll identity; summarize it with
`tools/analyze_scanout.py`. `DKC1_DISABLE_METAL_PRESENTER=1` restores the
SDL/Mach compatibility path.
`DKC1_USE_DISPLAY_LINK_PACING=1` opts into the macOS 14+ window-bound
display-link path for A/B testing; `DKC1_KEEP_RENDERER_VSYNC=1` restores the
renderer wait independently. `DKC1_DISABLE_DISPLAY_LINK=1` and
`DKC1_DISABLE_VSYNC=1` remain explicit negative overrides.
`SNESRECOMP_INPUT_PLAY=path` supplies the same deterministic
per-frame input playback supported by the Windows debugger for visible Mac QA.

**Escape → Settings → Aquatic widescreen fixes** enables the water-level
presentation improvements tested in this build. This experimental option is
off by default and takes effect after restarting the app. It includes native
edge protection, live water scroll alignment, cache-boundary and bottom-row
repairs, and verified Coral Capers wall continuations. Whole-game entrance
coverage is still incomplete; see [the validation record](docs/WIDESCREEN_WALL_SEAM.md).

The optional **Mods > Baby Kong** switch replaces active Donkey with Kiddy
Kong's DKC3 gameplay frames and a heavier, Kiddy-inspired movement profile.
Choose **Mods > Choose DKC3 ROM...** once to select the exact supported,
headerless North American DKC3 ROM; it is verified and decoded only in memory,
never copied into the app or repository. The mod is off by default and can be
toggled during play. DKC1's own semantic animation state drives Kiddy idle,
walk, run, jump, roll, carry, throw, hurt, rope, swim, and other matching pose
groups. See [docs/BABY_KONG_MOD.md](docs/BABY_KONG_MOD.md) for the ROM identity,
controlled-launch variables, behavior, and scope.

The native Mac host also supports controller feedback and external MSU-1
replacement music. A successful enemy stomp produces a short controller
rumble; normal jumps and contact damage do not. Set `DKC1_HAPTICS=0` to disable
it. Choose **Music > Choose MSU-1 Music Pack…** to select either a `.msu1`
archive or a folder containing `track-N.pcm`/`dkc_msu-N.pcm` files, then restart
the app. Archives are extracted to Application Support and remain outside the
repository and app bundle. The host follows DKC's requested music ID and start
state, maps the ID to track `ID+1`, memory-maps the pack's 44.1-kHz stereo PCM,
and preserves stock sound effects. Use
**Music > Disable Replacement Music** to return to the original soundtrack.
For controlled launches, `DKC1_MSU1_PACK=/path/to/extracted-pack` overrides the
saved selection and `DKC1_MSU1_DISABLE=1` bypasses it.

For visible widescreen debugging, `F7` pauses or resumes, `F8` advances one
frame while paused, and `F9` exports the rolling repro history when the flight
recorder is armed:

```powershell
$env:DKC1_FLIGHT_RECORDER = '1'
$env:DKC1_FLIGHT_RECORDER_DIR = "$env:TEMP\dkc1-repros"
.\build\dkc1_desktop.exe "C:\private\dkc1.sfc"
```

Set `DKC1_START_PAUSED=1` when opening a diagnostic snapshot to render that
exact state immediately without advancing a frame; F7 then resumes play.

The recorder keeps roughly one minute of input and periodic native snapshot
anchors in memory; it writes nothing until F9. Validate and deterministically
replay an exported bundle with:

```powershell
python tools\verify_flight_bundle.py "<bundle>" `
  --runner build\dkc1_snesrecomp_headless.exe --rom "C:\private\dkc1.sfc"
```

F11 save states written by current builds use native format v8 and include a
sparse snapshot of DKC1's host-only widescreen margin and placed-object phase
history. Older v4-v7 states remain loadable. Verify exact split-run continuity
with `tools\verify_widescreen_savestate.py`.

For intermittent culling, also set `DKC1_AUTO_EXPORT=1`. With the flight
recorder armed, a partial blank margin or a fully culled pair of margins in a
proven extended-gameplay frame automatically exports the same causal bundle
as F9. Fully black margins remain ignored on centered menus, logos, and fades.
Partial-height detection is boundary-connected: a flat band must start at the
centered 256-pixel seam and continue into the added margin. Authored holes that
begin later inside an otherwise rendered margin are not classified as culls.

For side art that appears only after a title/map/bonus/level transition, use
the clean-history oracle to distinguish retained host state from cartridge
VRAM/OAM data:

```powershell
python tools\bisect_transition_contamination.py `
  --runner build\dkc1_snesrecomp_headless.exe `
  --rom "C:\private\dkc1.sfc" --snapshot "<route-root.state>" `
  --input-play "<route-inputs.txt>" --good-frame 120 --bad-frame 180 `
  --output build\transition-bisect
```

The headless host accepts a frame count of `0` only for this diagnostic case:
it renders the exact loaded state without advancing emulation, rebuilding the
host-owned widescreen shadow from a clean history.

For an intermittent report anchored by an arbitrary native quicksave, fan the
same immutable state through deterministic movement branches without touching
the visible window:

```powershell
python tools\snapshot_widescreen_stress.py `
  --runner build\dkc1_headless_tools.exe `
  --layer-capture build\dkc1_layer_capture.exe `
  --rom "C:\private\dkc1.sfc" --snapshot quicksave.state `
  --output build\snapshot-stress --frames 420 --repeats 2
```

The runner applies fixed, diagonal, horizontal/vertical sweep, and box input
patterns. It requires exact repeat determinism and the strict margin grade. A
deterministic failure is rerun automatically with the exact trigger snapshot,
five surrounding frames, and BG1/BG2/BG3/OBJ/composite captures. Layer-capture
schema v2 also writes a backdrop-only frame and backdrop-subtracted occupancy
masks, allowing partial-height legacy-boundary culls to be distinguished from
transparent OBJ space or a shared fixed-color backdrop.

## Tool suite documentation

The complete debugging/verification tool suite (hosts and debug keys, all
env-gated evidence taps and integrity detectors, the route DSL, regression
contracts, and every script under `tools/`) is documented in one place:
`.claude/skills/dkc1-tools/` (`SKILL.md` for workflows, `TOOLS.md` for the
full reference). That guide also spells out the boundary between this
recomp's host-side widescreen and the retired asar/emulator ROM-hack
effort, which is kept only as reference material.

## Content boundary

- Never commit ROMs, saves, extracted assets, or generated game binaries.
- `recomp/*.cfg` contain only names, PCs, and structural metadata derived
  from the GPL-3 disassembly; provenance is recorded in each file header.
